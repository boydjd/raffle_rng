# How to verify the hash

1. Download and install *the exact version* of `python` listed in the post response
1. Download `verify.py` from this repository
1. Run the script
1. Input total slots
1. Input seed

If your seed and the number of slots are identical to what the bot said it used, it should match the winner and random number exactly.

You must be running the exact version of python that the bot is running for this to work properly.
