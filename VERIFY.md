# How to verify the hash

1. Download and install *the exact version* of `python` listed in the post response
1. Download `verify.py` from this repository
1. Replace `seed` with the seed you're testing
1. Replace `slots` with the maximum slots
1. Run the script and check the output with what the bot said the seed and random number were. 

If your seed and the number of slots are identical to what the bot said it used, it should match the bot's winner and random number exactly.

You must be running the exact version of python that the bot is running for this to work properly.
